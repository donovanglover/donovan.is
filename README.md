# is

This is the source code for my personal website [donovan.is](https://donovan.is).

## Structure

- `/blog/`: Technical blog
- `/archive/`: Old writing
- `/projects/`: Projects

## Concept

1. Content is separate from front-end code.
2. Static websites are fundamentally based on content and design; the framework used is merely a tool to reduce the amount of boilerplate code one writes.

## Topics

- Front-end web development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end web development. Authentication, Databases, etc.
- Web extension development. Firefox etc.
- Systems programming. Rust etc.
- Server administration. Linux etc.
