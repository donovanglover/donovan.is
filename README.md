# [donovan.is](https://donovan.is) üåê

This is the source code for my personal website [donovan.is](https://donovan.is).

It uses my [modified version of tabi](https://github.com/donovanglover/tabi) that adds [Turbo support](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) for instantaneous page loads and [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) for image viewing.

Additionally, it uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to bundle all JavaScript into one file, thus preventing new JavaScript files from having to be loaded from the server when navigating to cached pages.

It is deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/pages/) with modified [Caching Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/) to take advantage of caching on HTML pages.
