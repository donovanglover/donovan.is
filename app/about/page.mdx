# About

Hi I'm Donovan, a software engineer with experience in Linux, systems programming, and full stack web development.

I've been doing web development for over 10 years, way back when Ruby was cool, PHP was mainstream, and jQuery was the norm. Currently I specialize in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) <FaRust className="inline-block" /> for performance-critical applications, [Nix](https://nixos.org/) <SiNixos className="inline-block" /> / [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) <FaDocker className="inline-block" /> for DevOps, and [Node](https://nodejs.org/) <FaNodeJs className="inline-block" /> / [React](https://react.dev/) <FaReact className="inline-block" /> / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) <SiNextdotjs className="inline-block" /> for full stack web development.

I like working on websites and software that people use daily. If this sounds like your company or startup, say hello at <Email />.
