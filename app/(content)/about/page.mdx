# About

Hi I'm Donovan, a software engineer with experience in Linux, systems programming, and full stack web development.

I've been doing web development for over 10 years, way back when Ruby was cool, PHP was mainstream, and jQuery was the norm. Currently I specialize in <Nix />, <Rust />, and <TypeScript />.

You can find me on <GitHub /> and <Mastodon />.
