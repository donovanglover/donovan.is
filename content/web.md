Many people use the web on a daily basis. Websites make it easy for people and companies to distribute information to anyone with a web browser. Websites can also be used as a *Software as a Service* where people visit a website daily to read status updates, watch cat videos, generate AI art, send emails, and more.

Websites can be used to [addict people](https://web.archive.org/web/20190720142052/https://digitalpsychology.io/), [lock them into](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Dynamic_Competition) a certain product, and [compel them](https://www.deceptive.design/hall-of-shame) to do things they wouldn't normally do.

They can also be used to [help people](https://www.getgnulinux.org/), [promote yourself](https://mattbrictson.com/), or just be [*fun*](https://www.peppercarrot.com/).

I like what the web has to offer, and have taken the time to learn the ins and outs of [web engineering](https://icwe2023.webengineering.org/) so you don't have to. From fundamentals like [networking](https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/lower-web-stack/) and [servers](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/) to high-level abstractions like [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), [islands architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/islands-architecture) and [component-driven development](https://www.componentdriven.org/), I have a good understanding of the many different [strategies](https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/) involved in serving web-based content.

Below highlights some of my skills in this field.

## Front-end

- I have contributed to the [WHATWG HTML Specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) ([Pull Requests](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adonovanglover+is%3Aclosed)) and am familiar with the [CSS Working Group Editor Drafts](https://drafts.csswg.org/).
- I am fluent in [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) (both ES6+ and ES5) and have experience with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- I am proficient in [Firefox Developer Tools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/) and [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/).

## Back-end

- I have experience with [Linux servers](/linux/).
- I am familiar with languages like [Java](https://codingbat.com/java), [Python](https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv/pull/508/files), [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Rust](/rust/), and can easily learn new frameworks.
- I like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for databases.

## Technologies

- I use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to create fast content-centric websites.
- I use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) to create simple websites that have the speed of SPAs.
- I use [React](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to create highly performant web applications.

## Experience

I have prior experience with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (both 2 and 3), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/), [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/), [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/), [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), [Deno](https://deno.land/), [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html), [SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/get-started-developers) and [more](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/issues/1684). Web development is a fast-moving field and I am able to easily leverage new [technologies](https://web-frameworks-benchmark.netlify.app/result?asc=1&order_by=language) as needed.

## Maintenance

I have experience with maintaining projects over many years and understand the importance of simplicity and conservatism to avoid breakage. I also have experience migrating existing code bases to new technologies.
