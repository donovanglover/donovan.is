Hi, I'm Donovan.

I'm able to learn things in short amounts of time.[^learn]

I used to be a competitive programmer and won a few programming competitions.[^competitive]

Before that, I was a malware researcher.[^malware]

If you want to hire me, I specialize in [Linux](/linux/), [Rust](/rust/), and [full stack web development](/web/).

Outside of programming, I'm interested in linguistics and multisensory art.[^hobby]

<small class="footnotes">

[^learn]: I've taken over 100 online courses, including those from [Code School](https://web.archive.org/web/20170314104951/https://www.codeschool.com/). I self-studied [Calculus](https://github.com/donovanglover/awesome-calculus) at the age of 16. More recently, I'm prioritizing the skills I value the most to become really good at those skills.

[^competitive]: I was a [USACO Platinum Division contestant](https://web.archive.org/web/20200222222847/http://usaco.org/current/data/open17_gold_results.html) and [won a state-level programming challenge](https://www.gastc.org/s/2017_Scholarships.pdf) in a population of 10 million.

[^malware]: I specialized in malware analysis and mainly dealt with reverse engineering obfuscated JavaScript payloads.

[^hobby]: More specifically, I'm interested in the intersection between [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_analysis), [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity), [kinesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinaesthetics), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), and [visual arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Visual_arts_theory).
