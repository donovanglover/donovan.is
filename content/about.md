Hi, I'm Donovan.

I'm able to learn things in short amounts of time.

I used to be a competitive programmer and won a few programming competitions.

Before that, I was a malware researcher.

If you want to hire me, I specialize in [Linux](/linux/), [Rust](/rust/), and [full stack web development](/web/).

Outside of programming, I'm interested in linguistics and multisensory art.
