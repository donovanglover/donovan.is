[GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/) is a popular operating system among software engineers, privacy enthusiasts, and anyone interested in being in control of their computer. Most websites are served from [Linux servers](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Home_server) behind the scenes. Linux is also used for [kiosks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_kiosk) like self-checkout machines.

Below covers some of the ways I can help your company with Linux.

## Software Engineering

By combining my existing software development skills with my Linux knowledge, I am able to make applications and other programs [work](https://www.winehq.org/) on Linux.

If your company is looking to target Linux users, I am able to create [original software](https://gtk-rs.org/) that targets Linux users, or [cross-platform applications](https://tauri.app/) that work on all major operating systems including Linux.

## Package Management

I am a package maintainer for [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_NixOS_Linux_distribution). I write and maintain [Nix packages](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/) that can be used on any Linux distribution. I also [code review](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Adonovanglover+-author%3Adonovanglover+) the packages of others.

Here is a [list of packages I maintain](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&buckets={%22package_attr_set%22%3A[]%2C%22package_license_set%22%3A[]%2C%22package_maintainers_set%22%3A[%22Donovan%20Glover%22]%2C%22package_platforms%22%3A[]}&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=*). I also know how to create packages for [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) and `rpm`-based distributions like [Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/).

## System Administration

I have experience setting up and maintaining servers that use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/server), [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), and more. [I have installed Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Installation) before and am able to easily get acquainted with any Linux distribution.

I have experience with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) and [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) and am pretty good at [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/). Additionally, I am well versed with [systemd](https://systemd.io/) and the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html).
