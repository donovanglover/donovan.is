[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a modern systems programming language that emphasizes safety and correctness. Some key features of Rust include its usage of [`Option`s](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) and [`Result`s](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/). I use Rust where the performance of software is critical, security is important, and segmentation faults are not an option.

I like [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). I also know how to use [GitHub Workflows](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/) for [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), and have prior experience with other systems like [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/). Overall, I have an excellent understanding of how the software development cycle works through hands-on experience with [many](https://github.com/donovanglover/hyprdim) [open](https://github.com/donovanglover/hyprnome) [source](https://github.com/donovanglover/thud) [projects](https://github.com/donovanglover/sakaya).

Below covers some of my interests.

## Systems Programming

I am interested in writing software that operating systems and other software use. Examples include libraries, command-line tools, and microservices.

## Creative Development

I am interested in writing software that enables people to produce creative output. Examples include editors, engines, and artificial intelligence.

## Web Engineering

I am interested in writing software that makes the lives of web developers easier. Examples include fast binaries that solve common problems when creating web applications.
