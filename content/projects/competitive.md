I was a competitive programmer. I used [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and [Java](https://dev.java/) to solve programming contests. Most notably, I was the only student at my school to achieve [USACO Platinum Division](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=contests).

## Advice for USACOers

If you are interested in becoming a competitive programmer, there is a website called [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) that was created by your fellow USACO contestants.

Although this resource didn't exist when I participated in USACO, I think it's an excellent resource for anyone interested in algorithms in general.
